These are the first code snippets for an SBC / wearable for voice recognition of medical personnel when performing medical assessment; voice data is constantly stored and updated to be used in the early diagnosis of the patient and thus avoid very common errors, especially in pre-hospital medicine.
I am currently studying medical emergencies at the Mexican Red Cross and I found a way of expressing myself by wanting to assist myself with a technological resource such as wearable.
It is a project that arose from the fact that in pre-hospital medical care and medical emergencies, mistakes are frequently made; which can be avoided with the magic of technology.
Technically I want to do the hardware part, low level, in C language and Pyhyton for speech recognition and interaction with the outside world.
